## About Me
Data Scientist with a strong engineering background, focused on applying machine learning, statistical modeling, and analytics to solve complex system level problems. I build AI/ML enabled applications, automate data pipelines, and deploy scalable analytics solutions using Python and SQL to improve engineering workflows and data driven decision making. I am particularly passionate about using data science to enhance engineering systems where modeling, simulation, and real world constraints intersect.

### ⚽ Predicting Soccer Match Outcomes
📝 [**Code**](https://github.com/Cevdet-C/soccer-match-outcomes)  

**Problem:** Predict English Premier League match outcomes (home win, draw, away win) using historical team and match data.  

**Data:** Match stats (goals, shots, attendance, etc.) from 2020–2025 seasons and team values from Transfermarkt.  

**Approach:** Engineered features, built and compared models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with scaling, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.  

**Results:** Tuned XGBoost achieved 60% test accuracy and 0.70 weighted AUC. Team value, recent form, and scoring trends were top predictors; draws were hardest to predict due to class imbalance.  

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib.
